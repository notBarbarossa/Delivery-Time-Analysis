2. heavy discounting (especially combined with high delivery/payment fees) leads to a lower profit margin

3. Average delivery time is 73_min.
4. However, a few orders took longer than 90 minutes, indicating potential outliers or delays.
5. The histogram shows a peak in the 20â€“40 minute range, suggesting that the majority of orders are completed within a reasonable time

## 1.2 Recommendation

1. Investigate orders with delivery times over 90 minutes to identify recurring issues.

2. Consider flagging those as delay cases and reviewing delivery partner logs or customer feedback for root causes
